<h2> Note: Your code should be written in ES6 </h2>

<h4> 1. Check if a number exists in a given array </h4>

Create a function that takes two arguments: a number and an array. The function should return true if the number exists in the array and false if it doesnt. 

Example 1: 
``` 
Input: (2, [1, 3, 2] )
Output: true
```

Example 2: 
``` 
Input: (5, [1, 3, 2] )
Output: false
```
<br/>
<br/>

<h4> 2. Return an array of unique elements in a given array </h4>

You are given a single array that may or may not contain repeated integers. Your function should go through this array and return an array that contains unique (non-repeating) elements. 

Example 1: 
``` 
Input: [2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5] 
Output: [2, 3, 4, 5]
```

Example 2: 
``` 
Input: [1, 5, 4] 
Output: [1, 5, 4]
```

<h4> Note: Your solution must use objects </h4>

<h4> 3. Adding Two Numbers that are reversed arrays </h4>

You are given two non-empty arrays representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order and each of the elements contain a single digit. Add the two numbers and return it as an array.

You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

Example:

``` 
Input: [2, 4, 3] + [5, 6, 4]
Output: [7, 0, 8]
Explanation: 342 + 465 = 807.
```
